Classic-style retweets for #NewTwitter. Because sometimes you want to rock it old school.

[http://jonpierce.github.com/classic-retweet/](http://jonpierce.github.com/classic-retweet/)

Currently comes in three flavors: 1) a Chrome extension, 2) a Firefox extension, and 3) a bookmarklet, all available [here](http://jonpierce.github.com/classic-retweet/). Requests? Feedback? <a href="mailto:jonpierce+classic-retweet@gmail.com?subject=Classic Retweet">Email me</a>.

Note: If you use the bookmarklet, bear in mind that you'll have to periodically re-click it since #NewTwitter still occasionally reloads the entire page.
